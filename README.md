👋🏽 Hi, I'm Manasi Choughule!

🌇 Originally from Mumbai, India, and now based in Pennsylvania, I'm a data enthusiast who has undergone a transformative journey from senior software developer to data scientist/analyst. I'm passionate about leveraging data to extract insights, solve complex problems, and drive informed decisions.

🎓 With a Master's of Science in Data Analytics Engineering, I've pursued my education across continents, having traveled over 7987 miles to fulfill my dream of global education. Computers have always fascinated me; I enjoy learning new concepts, analyzing data, coding diverse applications, and automating everyday tasks. I'm the type of person who willingly spends a day automating a 30-minute routine.

📚 Prior to my master's program, I honed my skills at The MITRE Corporation as a Data Scientist intern for my capstone project. Our focus was on developing an algorithm to automate data tagging using machine learning, showcasing my commitment to innovation and problem-solving. Before that, I spent over 3.5 years at Zeus Learning as a Senior Software Developer, where I built applications from scratch, streamlined processes, and optimized team efficiency. My experience has enriched my technical abilities and teamwork skills.

💻 As I look ahead, my path unfolds as a Data Scientist, where I aspire to utilize my analytical mindset to assist businesses in making data-driven decisions. My expertise lies in analyzing data, uncovering patterns, and deriving actionable insights. I'm captivated by the power of data to reveal hidden opportunities and solve real-world challenges. The art of transforming raw data into a compelling story is my passion, ensuring that the insights are not only accurate but also impactful.
